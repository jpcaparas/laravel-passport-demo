# Laravel Passport Demo

## Overview

This repo was created to be presented in one of [Pixel Fusion](https://pixelfusion.co.nz)'s engineering talks.

The steps listed here aim to give a basic understanding of how Laravel Passport, an OAuth2 server implementation, can be used to develop API-driven web applications.

This app is expected to run with **very minimal fuss** .

## Installing dependencies

1. run `composer install`
1. run `yarn install` or `npm install`

## Serving the application

If you already have [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/valet), great; if not, use `./artisan serve` instead to spin up a PHP web server.

## Demo steps/topics

- [ ] Configuring the server
- [ ] Password grant
- [ ] Consuming your own API
- [ ] Testing with Postman
